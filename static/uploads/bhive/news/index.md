## bHIVE 0.99.3

### Module Integration

Modules previously accepted by `AINet$new()` were stored on the
algorithm but never invoked by the fit loop. v0.99.3 wires every module
into `AINet$fit()` so it affects predictions:

- `init` (`VDJLibrary` or any object exposing `$generate(n, X)`) now
  controls initial-repertoire construction. When supplied, it overrides
  `initMethod`. This makes V(D)J combinatorial assembly the actual
  starting state rather than dead metadata.
- `idiotypic` (`IdiotypicNetwork`) is now invoked between clonal
  selection and network suppression. The bell-curve
  `idiotypic_dynamics_cpp` kernel culls antibodies in over-clumped
  niches (suppression) and isolated antibodies (insufficient
  stimulation). A safety net keeps the top-10% population when ill-tuned
  thresholds would kill every antibody, so the iteration can continue
  and downstream selection can penalize the config.
- `activation` (`ActivationGate`) now pre-screens antibodies in
  over-dense feature-space neighborhoods *out* of each round of clonal
  selection. Gated antibodies sit aside unchanged while selection runs
  on the sparse subset, then rejoin the repertoire. In classification
  mode their class labels are refreshed by majority-vote of their
  nearest data points so pre-allocated random labels do not poison final
  predictions.
- `microenvironment` (`Microenvironment`) is assessed each iteration
  after clonal selection. Its `mutation_modifiers` scale a per-antibody
  Gaussian jitter applied in feature units (`0.5%` of feature SD on iter
  1, decaying with `mutationDecay`). Sparse-region antibodies explore
  outward, dense-region antibodies stabilize.
- `germinalCenter` (`GerminalCenter`) now runs Tfh-mediated quality
  selection after clonal-selection rejoin. Survivor indices are composed
  across selection rounds and mirrored onto `antibody_classes` and the
  adaptive-SHM moment matrices so external per-antibody state stays
  aligned. `GerminalCenter$select()` now returns the composed survivor
  vector (relative to the input repertoire) and exposes it as
  `$last_survivors`.
- `classSwitcher` (`ClassSwitcher`) runs after `microenvironment` and
  binds each antibody’s isotype (IgM/IgG/IgA) to its zone. The
  population-mean per-isotype alpha is then used as the *next*
  iteration’s affinity kernel width, modulating matching breadth based
  on the current density landscape. Requires `microenvironment` to be
  present.
- `memory` (`MemoryPool`) is invoked at two points. Pre-iteration, in
  clustering mode, relevant memory cells from prior fits are recalled
  (via `recall(X)`) and merged into the starting repertoire so prior
  knowledge seeds the search. Post-iteration, after orphan pruning, the
  surviving high-affinity antibodies are archived back into the pool
  (`archive()`) so they persist across fits. Classification archives
  also attach `class_label` to repertoire metadata so future consumers
  can read them back; recall is suppressed for classification to avoid
  label loss.
- `shm` (`SHMEngine`) is now dispatched inside
  `clonal_selection_iteration_cpp` rather than ignored. All five
  strategies — `uniform`, `airs`, `hotspot`, `energy`, `adaptive` —
  produce distinct mutation behavior. The adaptive strategy’s Adam-style
  first/second moment matrices are threaded through the C++ kernel and
  re-aligned in R after every subset/reorder operation (activation
  gating, germinal-center selection, idiotypic culling, network
  suppression) so per-antibody moment tracking stays consistent across
  iterations.

### C++ Backend

- `clonal_selection_iteration_cpp` now accepts SHM dispatch parameters
  (`shm_method`, `shm_c_rate`, `shm_temperature`, `shm_E_0`,
  `shm_base_rate`, `shm_beta1`, `shm_beta2`, `shm_adam_epsilon`) plus
  adaptive moment matrices `m1_state`/`m2_state`. The R wrapper provides
  defaults (`shm_method = "uniform"`, empty state matrices) so legacy
  callers that pass the original 15 arguments still get the previous
  behavior.
- New `src/shm.h` exposes the five SHM strategy helpers and a
  `mutate_by_method` dispatcher shared by `shm_mutate_cpp` and
  `clonal_selection_iteration_cpp`. The helpers are no longer `static`.

### New Behavior

- Orphan-antibody pruning: `AINet$fit()` now drops surviving antibodies
  that are not the nearest neighbor to any training point before
  computing the final assignment. Eliminates ghost antibodies that pass
  suppression but bind nothing, and tightens the relationship between
  cluster count and effective antibody count.
- `antibody_classes` is now pre-allocated before the iteration loop in
  classification mode (uniform random over `levels(y)`), so the new
  pre-selection gate logic has a value to index into on iteration 1
  rather than referencing a not-yet-defined variable.

## bHIVE 0.99.2

### Breaking Changes

- Removed regression task support across the package. The previous
  regression implementation was unreliable and is being redesigned.
  [`bHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/bHIVE.md),
  [`honeycombHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/honeycombHIVE.md),
  [`swarmbHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/swarmbHIVE.md),
  [`refineB()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/refineB.md),
  `AINet`, `GerminalCenter`, `bHIVEmodel`, `honeycombHIVEmodel`, and
  [`visualizeHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/visualizeHIVE.md)
  no longer accept `task = "regression"` or numeric `y`.
- Removed regression-only loss functions (`mse`, `huber`, `poisson`) and
  regression metrics (`rmse`, `mae`, `r2`) from
  [`swarmbHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/swarmbHIVE.md).
- Removed `refineHuberDelta` parameter from
  [`honeycombHIVE()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/bhive/reference/honeycombHIVE.md)
  and `honeycombHIVEmodel`.
- `final_assignment_cpp()` no longer accepts `antibody_values` or
  `overall_mean` arguments.
