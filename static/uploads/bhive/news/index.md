# Changelog

## bHIVE 0.99.1

### C++ Backend

- Added RcppArmadillo backend for BLAS-optimized bulk affinity and
  distance matrix computation, replacing per-element R loops
- Scalar affinity function for clone/mutate hot path avoids 1x1 matrix
  allocation overhead
- C++ implementations for clonal selection iteration, network
  suppression, kmeans++ initialization, final assignment, somatic
  hypermutation (5 methods), and idiotypic network dynamics

### R6 Class Architecture

- New `ImmuneRepertoire` class for antibody collections with metadata
  tracking (isotype, state, age, lineage)
- New `ImmuneAlgorithm` abstract base class with fit/predict/summary
  interface
- New `AINet` class wrapping core algorithm with composable module
  injection
- Both R6 composition and functional API equally supported

### New Modules

- `SHMEngine` — Five somatic hypermutation strategies: uniform (original
  behavior), airs (affinity-proportional), hotspot
  (feature-gradient-weighted), energy (budget-constrained), and adaptive
  (per-feature Adam-like moment tracking)
- `IdiotypicNetwork` — Antibody-antibody network dynamics with
  bell-shaped activation function replacing epsilon-threshold
  suppression
- `GerminalCenter` — T-follicular helper mediated selection with
  task-aware quality scoring and resource competition
- `Microenvironment` — Density-dependent zone classification
  (stable/explore/boundary) with chemokine-like gradient computation
- `VDJLibrary` — Combinatorial V(D)J gene library initialization via
  PCA, k-means clustering, or random partition of feature space
- `ActivationGate` — Two-signal activation gate requiring both antigen
  recognition and costimulatory context (density, danger, or entropy)
- `MemoryPool` — Archive high-affinity antibodies as long-lived memory
  cells with threshold-based recall
- `ClassSwitcher` — Isotype class switching (IgM broad, IgG specific,
  IgA boundary) modulating effective kernel width
- `ConvergentSelector` — Cross-repertoire consensus identification of
  public antibodies for ensemble methods

### Documentation

- Complete README rewrite covering functional API, R6 API, module
  reference table, and architecture overview
- New pkgdown website with Bootstrap 5 Flatly theme, organized reference
  groups, and tutorial navigation
- New article: “Composing Immune Modules” — R6 composition patterns for
  all 9 modules with worked examples
- New article: “Advanced Tuning & Workflows” — swarmbHIVE grid search,
  honeycombHIVE multilayer refinement, refineB optimizer comparison,
  caret integration, and visualizeHIVE plot types
- New article: “Algorithm & Biological Foundations” — comprehensive
  mathematical reference covering all affinity kernels, distance
  functions, SHM strategies, idiotypic ODE system, germinal center
  selection, and parameter guidance
- Added roxygen [@examples](https://github.com/examples) to refineB,
  bHIVEmodel, and ImmuneAlgorithm (now 90% example coverage)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated pkgdown deployment to borch.dev

### Package Infrastructure

- Created `R/bHIVE-package.R` with roxygen-managed `@useDynLib` and
  `@importFrom Rcpp sourceCpp` directives
- Added `%||%` operator `@name null-coalesce` to avoid illegal
  characters in Rd `\name` field
- Moved tutorial vignettes to `vignettes/articles/` (pkgdown-only, not
  installed with package) to reduce installed size
- Added pkgdown configuration (`_pkgdown.yml`) with 7 reference groups
  and structured article hierarchy

### BiocCheck Compliance

- Replaced all [`sapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html) calls
  with [`vapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html) in bHiVE.R and
  visualizeHIVE.R
- Replaced all `1:n` patterns with
  [`seq_len()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html) /
  [`seq_along()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html)
- Removed
  [`install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)
  calls from vignettes
- Removed `LazyData: true` from DESCRIPTION
- Updated R dependency to \>= 4.5.0
- Updated biocViews to
  `Software, Clustering, Classification, Regression, Network`
- Added class-level `@param` documentation for all R6 initialize()
  arguments across 11 module classes
- Added `@param ... Not used.` to all R6
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) methods

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed kmeans++ sampling: corrected cumulative sum fallback index and
  runif-to-integer cast
- Fixed cosine similarity epsilon (1e-12) for numerical stability
- Fixed division-by-zero guard in idiotypic dynamics when theta_low
  equals theta_high
- Fixed VDJLibrary NaN in kmeans for single-allele edge cases
- Fixed VDJLibrary NA subscript when feature dimensions not divisible by
  3
- Removed duplicate `Classification` from biocViews, added `Clustering`
- Fixed vignette YAML parsing error from bare `---` horizontal rule
