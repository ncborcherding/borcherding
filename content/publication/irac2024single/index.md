abstract: Single-cell T cell and B cell antigen receptor-sequencing data analysis can potentially perform in-depth assessments of adaptive immune cells that inform on understanding immune cell development to tracking clonal expansion in disease and therapy. However, it has been extremely challenging to analyze and interpret T cells and B cells and their adaptive immune receptor repertoires at the single-cell level due to not only the complexity of the data but also the underlying biology. In this Review, we delve into the computational breakthroughs that have transformed the analysis of single-cell T cell and B cell antigen receptor-sequencing data.
