abstract: 

**Background:** Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC exhibit distinct molecular and clinical characteristics. Although checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficiency in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response variability persists regardless of HPV status. This study aimed to explore the CD8+ T-cell landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC.

**Methods:** We performed simultaneous single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from treatment-naïve HPV-negative HNSCC patients. Additionally, cells were stimulated ex vivo, which allowed for the tracking of clonal transcriptomic responses.

**Results:** Our analysis identified a subset of CD8+ TILs highly enriched for interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). TCR analysis revealed ISG cells are clonally related to a population of granzyme K (GZMK)-expressing cells. However, unlike GZMK cells, which exhibited rapid effector-like phenotypes following stimulation, ISG cells were transcriptionally inert. Additionally, ISG cells showed specific enrichment within tumor and were found across multiple tumor entities.

**Conclusions:** ISG-enriched CD8+ TILs are a consistent feature of various tumor entities. These cells are poorly understood but possess characteristics that may impact antitumor immunity. Understanding the unique properties and functionality of ISG cells could offer innovative treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes in HPV-negative HNSCC and other cancer types.
