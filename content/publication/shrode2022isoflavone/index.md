abstract: Introduction: Phytoestrogens found in soy, fruits, peanuts, and other legumes, have been identified as metabolites capable of providing beneficial effects in multiple pathological conditions due to their ability to mimic endogenous estrogen. Interestingly, the health-promoting effects of some phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones, are dependent on the presence of specific gut bacteria. Specifically, gut bacteria can metabolize isoflavones into equol, which has a higher affinity for endogenous estrogen receptors compared to dietary isoflavones. We have previously shown that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory disease, lack gut bacteria that are able to metabolize phytoestrogen. Further, we have validated the importance of both isoflavones and phytoestrogen-metabolizing gut bacteria in disease protection utilizing an animal model of MS. Specifically, we have shown that an isoflavone-rich diet can protect from neuroinflammatory diseases, and that protection was dependent on the ability of gut bacteria to metabolize isoflavones into equol. Additionally, mice on a diet with isoflavones showed an anti-inflammatory response compared to the mice on a diet lacking isoflavones. However, it is unknown how isoflavones and/or equol mediates their protective effects, especially their effects on host metabolite levels.

Objectives: In this study, we utilized untargeted metabolomics to identify metabolites found in plasma that were modulated by the presence of dietary isoflavones.

Results: We found that the consumption of isoflavones increased anti-inflammatory monounsaturated fatty acids and beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids while reducing pro-inflammatory glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, phenylalanine metabolism, and arachidonic acid derivatives.

Conclusion: Isoflavone consumption alters the systemic metabolic landscape through concurrent increases in monounsaturated fatty acids and beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids plus reduction in pro-inflammatory metabolites and pathways. This highlights a potential mechanism by which an isoflavone diet may modulate immune-mediated disease.
