abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, is modeled in mice as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). While CD4+ T cells, primarily Th1 and Th17 subsets, drive disease pathogenesis, the exact function of CD8+ T cells remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that adoptively transferred myelin-reactive CD8+ T cells (PLP-CD8) prevent EAE induction and suppress ongoing disease through the engagement of MHC Class-I in recipient mice. Here, we show that PLP-CD8 induce regulatory changes in both subsets of conventional dendritic cells (cDC1 and CD11b+ cDC) in vivo and in vitro. Adoptively transferred PLP-CD8 promoted both cDC subsets to adopt a mature and regulatory phenotype with an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and a reduced capacity to support CD4+ T cell proliferation. In vitro, PLP-CD8 induced similar phenotypic changes in both cDC subsets in an antigen-specific, dose-dependent manner. PLP-CD8 directly interacted with cDC1 and indirectly influenced CD11b+ cDC through paracrine signaling. Notably, direct interaction with PLP-CD8 had detrimental effects on CD11b+ cDC. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of key immunoregulatory genes, such as Foxo3, in both cDC subsets with enrichment of pathways involved in immune regulation and T cell differentiation. Our study highlights a novel mechanism in which myelin-reactive CD8+ T cells directly interact with cDC1 and modulate CD11b+ cDC through paracrine mechanisms to induce mature, regulatory dendritic cells, which leads to inhibited CD4+ T cell responses and reduced EAE pathogenesis.
