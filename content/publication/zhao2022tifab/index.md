abstract: We previously showed stabilization of NIK-induced activation of NF-κB non-canonical signaling suppresses MLL-AF9-induced AML. In the current study, we demonstrate that deletion of NF-κB non-canonical RelB prevents the inhibitory effect of NIK stabilization in MLL-AF9 AML. Mechanistically, RelB suppresses its direct target, TIFAB, which is upregulated in human AML and correlates negatively with the survival of AML patients. Forced expression of TIFAB reverses NIK-induced impaired AML development through downregulation of RelB and upregulation of HOXA9. Consistent with upregulation of HOXA9, gene set enrichment analysis shows that forced expression of TIFAB blocks myeloid cell development, upregulates leukemia stem cell signature and induces similar gene expression patterns to those of HOXA9-MEIS1 and HOXA9-NUP98, and upregulates oxidative phosphorylation. Accordingly, forced expression of HOXA9 also largely releases the inhibitory impact of NIK stabilization via downregulation of RelB and upregulation of RelA. Our data suggest that NIK/RelB suppresses MLL-AF9-induced AML mainly through downregulation of TIFAB/HOXA9.
