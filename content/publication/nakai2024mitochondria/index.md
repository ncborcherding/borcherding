abstract: Mitochondria transfer is a recently described phenomenon in which donor cells deliver mitochondria to acceptor cells. One possible consequence of mitochondria transfer is energetic support of neighbouring cells; for example, exogenous healthy mitochondria can rescue cell-intrinsic defects in mitochondrial metabolism in cultured ρ0 cells or Ndufs4−/− peritoneal macrophages. Exposing haematopoietic stem cells to purified mitochondria before autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation allowed for treatment of anaemia in patients with large-scale mitochondrial DNA mutations, and mitochondria transplantation was shown to minimize ischaemic damage to the heart, brain and limbs. However, the therapeutic potential of using mitochondria transfer-based therapies to treat inherited mitochondrial diseases is unclear. Here we demonstrate improved morbidity and mortality of the Ndufs4−/− mouse model of Leigh syndrome (LS) in multiple treatment paradigms associated with mitochondria transfer. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type mice, which is associated with release of haematopoietic cell-derived extracellular mitochondria into circulation and transfer of mitochondria to host cells in multiple organs, ameliorates LS in mice. Furthermore, administering isolated mitochondria from wild-type mice extends lifespan, improves neurological function and increases energy expenditure of Ndufs4−/− mice, whereas mitochondria from Ndufs4−/− mice did not improve neurological function. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-species administration of human mitochondria to Ndufs4−/− mice also improves LS. These data suggest that mitochondria transfer-related approaches can be harnessed to treat mitochondrial diseases, such as LS.
