Nick is an Assistant Professor in the **Department of Pathology and Immunology** at Washington University School of Medicine.  
His clinical responsibilities include human leukocyte antigen testing in the contexts of transplant, autoimmunity, and cancer.

He earned his **MD/PhD** as part of the Medical Scientist Training Program at the **University of Iowa**, where he was mentored by
[Jon Brestoff](https://brestofflab.com/) and [David DeNardo](https://www.icce-wustl.org/david-denardo-lab.html).  
His research focuses on the use of **innate cellular barcodes**—including mitochondrial genomes and adaptive immune receptor sequences—to track immune responses and predict clinical outcomes.

Nick develops open-source software for immune repertoire analysis, including
[scRepertoire](https://github.com/ncborcherding/scRepertoire),
[escape](https://github.com/ncborcherding/escape),
[Trex](https://github.com/ncborcherding/Trex),
[Ibex](https://github.com/BorchLab/Ibex),
and [immReferent](https://github.com/BorchLab/immReferent).
