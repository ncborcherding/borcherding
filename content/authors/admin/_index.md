Nick Borcherding is a physician–scientist whose work bridges **computational 
immunology**, **clinical pathology**, and **transplant immunogenetics**. He 
serves as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology 
at **Washington University School of Medicine**, where his clinical practice 
focuses on human leukocyte antigen  testing for transplantation, autoimmunity, 
and cancer immunotherapy.

Nick’s research explores how the adaptive immune system encodes and recalls 
disease experiences. His lab integrates single-cell sequencing, systems 
immunology, and machine learning to map immune diversity and predict clinical 
outcomes. A particular focus is on the use of **innate and adaptive cellular 
barcodes**, including mitochondrial genomes and immune receptor repertoires, to 
trace clonal relationships across tissues and disease states.

Beyond his laboratory and clinical roles, Nick is deeply invested in open data 
science. He develops widely used open-source software for immune repertoire 
and single-cell analysis, including
