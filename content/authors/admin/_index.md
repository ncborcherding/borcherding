Nick is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology at Washington University St Louis. His clinical responsibilities include human leukocyte antigen testing in the context of transplant, autoimmunity, and cancer. He recieved his MD/PhD from the University of Iowa, as part of the medical scientist training program. He was a member of the Washington University Department of Pathology and Immunology dual residency and post-doc PSTP program. He was co-mentored by [Jon Brestoff](https://brestofflab.com/) and [David DeNardo](https://www.icce-wustl.org/david-denardo-lab.html). His research focused on the use of innate cellular barcodes, such as mitochondrial genome and adaptive immune receptor sequences, to track immune responses and predict clinical outcomes.

In his free time, Nick likes to write R packages for the single-cell community, including [scRepertoire](https://github.com/ncborcherding/scRepertoire), [escape](https://github.com/ncborcherding/escape), and [Trex](https://github.com/ncborcherding/Trex). In addition, he has compiled the largest immune single-cell RNA/TCR data set for tumors, which is freely available to [anyone](https://github.com/ncborcherding/utility).
