He is co-mentored by [Jon Brestoff](https://brestofflab.com/) and [David DeNardo](https://www.icce-wustl.org/david-denardo-lab.html) investigating the role mitochondria transfer between immune and stromal cells in adipose tissue and the tumor microenvironment.  

In his free time, Nick likes to write R packages for the single-cell community, including [scRepertoire](https://github.com/ncborcherding/scRepertoire), [escape](https://github.com/ncborcherding/escape), and [Trex](https://github.com/ncborcherding/Trex). In addition, he has compiled the largest immune single-cell RNA/TCR data set for tumors, which is freely available to [anyone](https://github.com/ncborcherding/utility).
